Before sending me a message, please take into account the following:<br><br>
1. Preface the subject line with [PGP] and don't encrypt the subject line*.<br>
2. Don't expect an immediate response, especially if I haven't corresponded with you before.<br>
3. Don't go into deeply controversial topics*.<br>
4. Don't include photos - plaintext only!*.<br>
5. Don't spam me*.<br>
6. Don't send me unsolicited attachments* (Your PGP public key is excluded from this rule, of course.).<br>
<br>
*Violations of these expectations will automatically result in me ignoring your email message, and perhaps you will be blocked.<br>

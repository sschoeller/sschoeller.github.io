<b>My Library</b>
<br>
<p>I have a growing professional library. The highlight of which is a special collection of sorts known as "Knuth's Korner" (special spelling intended). 
This collection, sitting near the corner of my desk, is intended to contain timeless classics that changed computing and biographical information of those visionaries.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the cornerstone of the collection is comprised of Knuth's works, such as: 
<i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> (partial set), <i>Selected Papers on Computer Languages</i>, <i>Selected Papers on Computer Science</i> 
and <i>Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms</i>. 
However, I add books by additional computer scientists and software engineers to maintain a decent collection of viewpoints.</p>

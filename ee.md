    <title>Easter Egg: My Bowtie Collection</title>
  </head>
<body>
I got into bowties in part due to Bill Nye's influence on my life. I frequently wear them to formal occasisons, although I can assure you -- 
the future employer -- <i>not</i> to job interviews and other work situations (unless it is a work-related party!).

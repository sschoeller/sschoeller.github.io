<h1>Stateline [WI-IL] Open Source Discussion Group</h1><br>
Caveat: The Stateline OSDG idea is a work-in-progress. This posting is more of an advance notice to hopefully get the local computer enthusiasts interested.  (I still need a venue.).<br>
<br><br>
<p>The group primarily focuses on open source software.<br> 
Topic examples: <a href="https://distrowatch.com/?language=EN">Linux &amp; BSD</a>*; WSL, Firefox, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, <a href="https://tug.org/">(La)TeX</a>, <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>, etc. General trends in computing also welcome. Open source demos possible!</p>
<br>
<p>Users, Admins and Programmers all welcome to attend!</p><br>
*The first planned topic will be sudo/sudoedit and commonly-used commands within <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">GNU coreutils</a>. After that, we can plan future topics by consensus!

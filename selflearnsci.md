<h1>Self-learning science</h1>
How to self-learn science? That is the goal of this page, currently under construction.<br>
The first thing to keep in mind for science at home (or homeschool), is that a computational research environment is one of those essential elements. To do so, you should invest in a quality computer. For Windows, I recommend getting 32 Gigs (GiB) of RAM (memory). For the other two major OS's, you can do with 16 GiB of RAM. The processor also matters, though RAM tends to be the bottleneck. 
<br>
Regarding Linux, there are Ubuntu Linux laptops available from Lenovo, as of the time of this writing (11/11/2025).<br> 
Ubuntu is a popular choice among government and academic scientists, in part due to its support period (10 years standard with <a href="https://ubuntu.com/pro">Pro</a>) for LTS releases and security features. Windows still is the predominant OS for many corporate research environments. 
You also can&apos;t go wrong with Apple products. One of the labs I worked at ran iMacs. Most scientific software programs are cross-platform, nowadays. However, it seems Linux tends to require the least resources, leaving more memory for your scientific programs to use (Most supercomputers run Linux.).<br>

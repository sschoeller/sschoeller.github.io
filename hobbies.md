<h1>Hobbies</h1>
1. Looking for star notes in circulating U.S. paper money (replaces defective currency)<br />
2. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sschoellerstem/sets/general">Classical music</a> (I also play piano, having taken lessons for about 11 years!)<br /> 
3. Gradually working on the goal of reading Vol. 1 of <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html">TAOCP</a> in full (I'm about 1/4 finished!)

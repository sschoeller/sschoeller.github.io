<h1>Welcome to the Homepage of Scott Schoeller!</h1><br>

<h2>About Me...</h2>
<p>I am well-rounded in scientific subjects, especially biology, chemistry and environmental studies, and last but not least, computer science!
In addition to my current work on my bioinformatics thesis, I have been co-published three times in the field of protein biochemistry.
My favorite accomplishments (thus far!) surround earning two Knuth Reward Checks. The corrected books were Volume 1 and Volume 1 Fascicle 1 of <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>, as well as <i>Selected Papers on Design of Algorithms</i>.</p> 
<p>Additional achievements include membership in The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi and various scholarships.</p><br>
